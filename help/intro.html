<header>Protected Directories</header>

This page allows you to add password protection for some or all website
directories for this virtual server. To protect a directory, use the 
<b>Add protection for a new directory</b> link. To remove protection, select
the checkbox next to the directory name and click the button below the list.<p>

Once protection has been setup, you can control which users have access to it
using the <b>Edit Mail and FTP Users</b> page. When you click on a user or
create a new one, the <b>Allow access to web directories</b> field can be
used to select one or more allow paths from the list you define here. <p>
